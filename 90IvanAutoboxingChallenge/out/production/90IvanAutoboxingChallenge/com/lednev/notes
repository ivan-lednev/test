What happens if we don't initialise a list through a constructor when we create an object?

I can't call to an object created through a branch, because it doesn't have a name. So all its functionality is
available only through the Branch.

I should add comments on the side, otherwise the code looks cluttered.

It's not clear where to put all the validation code. In the Main? In the other class?

Validations are not a trivial task.
